# cse15l-lab-reports
To build this site, I am using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), a static site generator. I prefer the looks and ergonomics over Jekyll which is what Github Pages uses under the hood. 

If you want to see the work I did in the lab on the 14th of January, you can look at the [bare](https://github.com/ocboogie/cse15l-lab-reports/tree/bare) branch.
